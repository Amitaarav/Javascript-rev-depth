## Debouncing
 We use debouncing to manage an event which is occuring way fast than browser or we as frontend developer can handle.

 By using Debouncing we can enforce 2 restrictions

 1. Between the firsst function call and the next function call there will be a certain delay
 2. If the function call happens before the specified certain delay, then the function call again have to wait dor the specified delay again
